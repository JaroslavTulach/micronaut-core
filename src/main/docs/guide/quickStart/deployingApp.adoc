To deploy a Micronaut application you create a runnable JAR file by running `./gradlew assemble` or `./mvnw package`.

The constructed JAR file can then be executed with `java -jar`. For example:

[source,bash]
----
$ java -jar build/libs/hello-world-all.jar
----

The runnable JAR can be executed locally, deployed to a virtual machine or managed Cloud service that supports runnable JARs.

To publish a layered application to a Docker container registry you can configure your Docker image name in `build.gradle` for Gradle:

[source,groovy]
----
dockerBuild {
    images = ["[REPO_URL]/[NAMESPACE]/my-image:$project.version"]
}
----

Then use `dockerPush` to push a built image of the application:

[source,bash]
----
$ ./gradlew dockerPush
----
